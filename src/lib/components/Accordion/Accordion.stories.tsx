        <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
          Flowbite is an open-source library of interactive components built on top of Tailwind CSS including buttons,
          dropdowns, modals, navbars, and more.

      <Accordion.Title>Is there a Figma file available?</Accordion.Title>
      <Accordion.Content>
        <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
          Flowbite is first conceptualized and designed using the Figma software so everything you see in the library
          has a design equivalent in our Figma file.

      <Accordion.Title>What are the differences between Flowbite and Tailwind UI?</Accordion.Title>
      <Accordion.Content>
        <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
          The main difference is that the core components from Flowbite are open source under the MIT license, whereas
          Tailwind UI is a paid product. Another difference is that Flowbite relies on smaller and standalone
          components, whereas Tailwind UI offers sections of pages.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
          However, we actually recommend using both Flowbite, Flowbite Pro, and even Tailwind UI as there is no
          technical reason stopping you from using the best of two worlds.
